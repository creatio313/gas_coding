Tools for studio-seginus

This is a scheduler tool of Studio-seginus. These codes are written in Google Apps Script.
If you want to use them, you need to copy them to Google Apps(or Drice) as Standalone or ContainerBindScript.

You can read the documantation in the below link, but this is written in Japanese.
I've written these codes only for our team's use, so I don't ensure its behaviour.
